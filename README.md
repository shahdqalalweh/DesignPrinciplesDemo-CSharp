# 🧠 SOLID Design Principles in C# – Guided Implementation

This repository contains hands-on implementations of core **SOLID Design Principles** in C#, created as a **direct follow-along** to the excellent video series by **Essam Abdelnaby** on YouTube.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific principle demonstrated in the series, and reflects the same examples and code structure explained by Essam.  
The purpose is to reinforce learning through practical repetition and alignment with the instructor's style.

## 🌟 What's Next?

This repository is focused on accurately following the tutorial content.  
In a separate repository, I will be applying these principles to **original mini-projects** with different contexts and ideas — to explore how design principles can be applied creatively and independently.

Stay tuned ✨

Made with ❤️ while learning from one of the best!
