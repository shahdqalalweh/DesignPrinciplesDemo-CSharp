# Design Principles in C# (Metigator Series)

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that demonstrate fundamental **Design Principles** in software engineering using **C# Console Applications**.

> ?? These projects were built as hands-on implementations of concepts taught in the  
> **["Design Principles" course by Metigator"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n1Qos4Tb6ThSyydEJTm7xJ3qEwE8Oyu)**.  
Each folder is a focused demo for a specific principle, showcasing clean, maintainable, and modular design techniques.

## ?? Principles Covered

| # | Principle | Code Folder | Summary |
|--|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Encapsulate What Varies** | [`EncapsulateWhatVaries`](./EncapsulateWhatVaries) | Isolate the parts of code that change often |
| 2 | **Favor Composition Over Inheritance** | [`FavorCompositionOverInheritance`](./FavorCompositionOverInheritance) | Use composition to reuse behavior dynamically |
| 3 | **Program to Interface** | [`ProgramToInterface`](./ProgramToInterface) | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations |
| 4 | **Loose Coupling** | [`LooseCoupling`](./LooseCoupling) | Reduce dependency between components |
| 5 | **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | [`SingleResponsibilityDemo`](./SingleResponsibilityDemo) | Each class should have only one reason to change |
| 6 | **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** | [`OpenClosedDemo`](./OpenClosedDemo) | Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification |
| 7 | **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** | [`LiskovSubstitutionDemo`](./LiskovSubstitutionDemo) | Subclasses should be substitutable for base classes |
| 8 | **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** | [`InterfaceSegregationDemo`](./InterfaceSegregationDemo) | Prefer multiple specific interfaces over one general interface |
| 9 | **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** | [`DependencyInversionDemo`](./DependencyInversionDemo) | Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes |
