# 🧠 Design Principles in C# – Practical Projects

This repository is a collection of simple C# Console Applications that demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Design Principles** in action.

The goal is to implement each principle with a focused mini-project that clearly shows how to apply it in real-world code.

> ✍️ This series is based on the excellent [Design Principles course by Metigator](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n1Qos4Tb6ThSyydEJTm7xJ3qEwE8Oyu)
